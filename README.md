# 👋 Hi, I'm Jivesh Gupta

🎓 BCA (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) student  
💻 Exploring AI, Machine Learning, and practical problem-solving through code

I like understanding *how things actually work* — whether it’s cleaning messy data, training a model, or improving code step by step.  
Most of my learning happens by building projects, experimenting, and fixing mistakes rather than just reading theory.

Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my foundations in AI/ML, writing better Python code, and applying what I learn to real datasets.
